`rsparse` is an R package for statistical learning primarily on **sparse matrices** -  **matrix factorizations, factorization machines, out-of-core regression**. Many of the implemented algorithms are particularly useful for **recommender systems** and **NLP**. 

We've paid some attention to the implementation details - we try to avoid data copies, utilize multiple threads via OpenMP and use SIMD where appropriate. Package **allows to work on datasets with millions of rows and millions of columns**.

# Features

### Classification/Regression

1. [Follow the proximally-regularized leader](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/mcmahan11b/mcmahan11b.pdf) which allows to solve **very large linear/logistic regression** problems with elastic-net penalty. Solver uses stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rates (so can be used for online learning - not necessary to load all data to RAM). See [Ad Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41159.pdf) for more examples.
    - Only logistic regerssion implemented at the moment
    - Native format for matrices is CSR - `Matrix::RsparseMatrix`. However common R `Matrix::CsparseMatrix` (`dgCMatrix`) will be converted automatically.
1. [Factorization Machines](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/Rendle2010FM.pdf) supervised learning algorithm which learns second order polynomial interactions in a factorized way. We provide highly optimized SIMD accelerated implementation.  

### Matrix Factorizations

1. Vanilla **Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization** - classic approch for "rating" prediction. See `WRMF` class and constructor option `feedback = "explicit"`. Original paper which indroduced MMMF could be found [here](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/Publications/MMMFnips04.pdf).

1. **Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF)** from [Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf). See `WRMF` class and constructor option `feedback = "implicit"`. 
We provide 2 solvers:
    1. Exact based on Cholesky Factorization
    1. Approximated based on fixed number of steps of **Conjugate Gradient**.
See details in [Applications of the Conjugate Gradient Method for Implicit Feedback Collaborative Filtering](http://www.sze.hu/~gtakacs/download/recsys_2011_draft.pdf) and [Faster Implicit Matrix Factorization](http://www.benfrederickson.com/fast-implicit-matrix-factorization/).
    * <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexyai/rsparse/master/docs/img/WRMF.png" width="400">
1. **Linear-Flow** from [Practical Linear Models for Large-Scale One-Class Collaborative Filtering](http://www.bkveton.com/docs/ijcai2016.pdf). Algorithm looks for factorized low-rank item-item similarity matrix (in some sense it is similar to [SLIM](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/774))
    * <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexyai/rsparse/master/docs/img/LinearFlow.png" width="300">
1. Fast **Truncated SVD** and **Truncated Soft-SVD** via Alternating Least Squares as described in [Matrix Completion and Low-Rank SVD via Fast Alternating Least Squares](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2596). Works for both sparse and dense matrices. Works on [float](https://github.com/wrathematics/float) matrices as well! For certain problems may be even faster than [irlba](https://github.com/bwlewis/irlba) package.
    * <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexyai/rsparse/master/docs/img/soft-svd.png" width="600">
1. **Soft-Impute** via fast Alternating Least Squares as described in [Matrix Completion and Low-Rank SVD via Fast Alternating Least Squares](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2596).
    * <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexyai/rsparse/master/docs/img/soft-impute.png" width="400">
    * with a solution in SVD form <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexyai/rsparse/master/docs/img/soft-impute-svd-form.png" width="150">
1. **GloVe** as described in [GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf).
    * This is usually used to train word embeddings, but actually also very useful for recommender systems.
1. Matrix scaling as descibed in [EigenRec: Generalizing PureSVD for Effective and Efficient Top-N Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06033)

*********************

_Note: the optimized matrix operations which `rparse` used to offer have been moved to a [separate package](https://github.com/david-cortes/MatrixExtra)_

# Installation 

Most of the algorithms benefit from OpenMP and many of them could utilize high-performance implementations of BLAS. If you want to make the maximum out of this package, please read the section below carefully.

It is recommended to:

1. Use high-performance BLAS (such as OpenBLAS, MKL, Apple Accelerate).
1. Add proper compiler optimizations in your `~/.R/Makevars`. For example on recent processors (with AVX support) and compiler with OpenMP support, the following lines could be a good option:

```
CXX11FLAGS += -O3 -march=native -fopenmp
CXXFLAGS   += -O3 -march=native -fopenmp
```

### Mac OS

If you are on **Mac** follow the instructions at [https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/](https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/). After `clang` configuration, additionally put a `PKG_CXXFLAGS += -DARMA_USE_OPENMP` line in your `~/.R/Makevars`. After that, install `rsparse` in the usual way. 

Also we recommend to use [vecLib](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/veclib) - Appleâ€™s implementations of BLAS.

```sh
ln -sf  /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/Current/libBLAS.dylib /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib
```

### Linux

On Linux, it's enough to just create this file if it doesn't exist (`~/.R/Makevars`).

If using OpenBLAS, it is highly recommended to use the `openmp` variant rather than the `pthreads` variant. On Linux, it is usually available as a separate package in typical distribution package managers (e.g. for Debian, it can be obtained by installing `libopenblas-openmp-dev`, which is not the default version), and if there are multiple BLASes installed, can be set as the default through the [Debian alternatives system](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/LinearAlgebraLibraries) - which can also be used [for MKL](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49842944/5941695).

### Windows

By default, R for Windows comes with unoptimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries, and `rsparse` will prefer using Armadillo's replacements instead. In order to use BLAS, **install `rsparse` from source** (not from CRAN), removing the option `-DARMA_DONT_USE_BLAS` from `src/Makevars.win` and ideally adding `-march=native` (under `PKG_CXXFLAGS`). See [this tutorial](https://github.com/david-cortes/R-openblas-in-windows) for instructions on getting R for Windows to use OpenBLAS. Alternatively, Microsoft's MRAN distribution for Windows comes with MKL.

# API

We follow [mlapi](https://github.com/dselivanov/mlapi) conventions.

# Release and configure

## Making release

Don't forget to add `DARMA_NO_DEBUG` to `PKG_CXXFLAGS` to skip bound checks (this has significant impact on NNLS solver)

```
PKG_CXXFLAGS = ... -DARMA_NO_DEBUG
```

## Configure

Generate configure:

```sh
autoconf configure.ac > configure && chmod +x configure
```
